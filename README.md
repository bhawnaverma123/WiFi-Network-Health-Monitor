# 📡 Wi-Fi Network Health Monitor Dashboard

> A full-stack WLAN monitoring dashboard that simulates how companies like **Aprecomm** analyze Wi-Fi network quality and user experience. Built with **Node.js, Express.js, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Wi-Fi Network Health Monitor** is a web application that takes 5 network parameters as input, runs a rule-based scoring engine, and produces:

- A **Network Health Score** (0–100)
- A **Status Label** (Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor)
- **Detected Issues** in the network
- **Smart Troubleshooting Recommendations**
- **Visual Analytics** with charts
- **Analysis History** stored locally in JSON

This project simulates the core functionality of real-world WLAN quality monitoring tools used by companies like Aprecomm, Ekahau, and NetSpot.

## 🧮 Health Score Logic

The total score (0–100) is the sum of 4 parameters, each worth **25 points maximum**:

### Signal Strength
| Range | Rating | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90–100% | Excellent | 25 |
| 70–89% | Good | 20 |
| 50–69% | Fair | 12 |
| Below 50% | Poor | 0 |

### Latency
| Range | Rating | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0–30 ms | Excellent | 25 |
| 31–80 ms | Good | 20 |
| 81–150 ms | Fair | 10 |
| Above 150 ms | Poor | 0 |

### Packet Loss
| Range | Rating | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0–1% | Excellent | 25 |
| 2–5% | Fair | 12 |
| Above 5% | Poor | 0 |

### Connected Devices
| Range | Rating | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1–10 | Good | 25 |
| 11–20 | Moderate | 12 |
| Above 20 | Heavy Load | 0 |

### Overall Status
| Total Score | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 85–100 | ✅ Excellent |
| 65–84 | 👍 Good |
| 40–64 | ⚠️ Fair |
| 0–39 | 🔴 Poor |
